## vue-start

Here is ready to clone vue.js project made with [vue-cli tool](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

### usage

Before building install node.js modules with `npm install` command. After that just run `npm run build` to get ready to deploy `dist` folder.

### configuration

To change project settings define them in `vue.config.js` file. For example, changing default baseUrl option from `'/'` to `'./'`:

```
module.exports = {
  baseUrl: './',
}
```
